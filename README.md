navigate through the application with ease.
4. Mobile-responsive: The application is designed to be mobile-responsive, which means that users can
access their schedules on their mobile devices.
Backend:
The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express, and it provides RESTful APIs that are
consumed by the frontend.The data from time table is being fetched through node js module XLSX.
The backend of the application consists of the following components:
1. Express.js: This is a Node.js framework that is used to build the backend of the application.
2. MongoDB: This is a NoSQL database that is used to store user data.
3. Mongoose: This is an ORM that is used to interact with the MongoDB database.
4. Passport.js: This is an authentication middleware that is used to authenticate users.
Frontend:
The frontend of the application is built using EJS templates, HTML, and CSS. EJS templates are used to
dynamically generate the HTML that is displayed on the frontend.
The frontend of the application consists of the following components:
1. EJS: This is a templating language that is used to generate dynamic HTML.
